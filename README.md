# BookIdeas
Not so much free software, but discussions of ideas for future books.

Writing a new book is a daunting prospect, and it would really help to know in advance whether there is sufficient interest in the subject to make it worthwhile.  So the purpose of this repository is to provoke and encourage discussion on whether anyone is interested in these proposals and what they would like to see.

It's based on the overview here: https://activityworkshop.net/books/ but hopefully the possibility of raising [Issues](https://github.com/activityworkshop/BookIdeas/Issues) on this repository will help stimulate feedback.

## GpsPrune user guide
This user guide for the [GpsPrune application](https://github.com/activityworkshop/GpsPrune) is already available, see here for more details: https://gpsprune.activityworkshop.net/userguide.html .

If you have any feedback, criticism, suggestions, or requests, you can raise them either here or in the GpsPrune repo.

## Geocaching for Geeks
As outlined on the web page, this proposal is for a collaboration project combining some technical / geeky / programming / puzzle topics together with practical applications to the hobby of geocaching.

Some ideas of things to discuss:
 * a brief introduction to geocaching for those who have never done it before (what is a cache, how to find simple caches with GPS, ways to use GpsPrune etc)
 * some theory (representation of GPS coordinates, different coordinate systems, terminology)
 * Cache databases
 * Multi-caches and calculations, some geocaching jargon like letter values, digit sums
 * Using maps and aerial imagery
 * Puzzle caches and Checkers
 * using Python or Java or spreadsheets to solve puzzles (at a getting started level)
 * techniques used in advanced puzzles, like data encoding systems (eg ascii, base64, hex, braille, semaphore, morse, qr), simple encryption systems (ROT13, monoalphabetic (Caesar), polyalphabetic (Vigen√®re), PGP, ...), other data-hiding tricks
 * Whereigo caches, Adventure Labs
 * online resources, tools, discussion forums, etiquette

Target audience:
 * People with some geocaching experience who want to increase their geek level, who want to add more tricks to their puzzle-solving toolset or find ways to expand their knowledge
 * People who are keen on number puzzles or programming, but have never done geocaching and are intrigued about getting started

Do you like the sound of those topics and the scope?  Anything you'd like to see here but isn't mentioned yet?  Would you strongly prefer `epub` to `pdf` or any other specific requests?  Any more suggestions for scope / intended audience?  Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/activityworkshop/BookIdeas/Issues)!


## Alpine Pass Route
This idea of writing an ebook about the Swiss hiking route (see https://activityworkshop.net/hiking/alpinepassroute ) has been thrown around for years but the response has been very low, and alternatives exist (on paper) already.  So I guess that this won't work, but I'll raise it again anyway.  Interested?  Or alternative ideas?  Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/activityworkshop/BookIdeas/Issues)!
