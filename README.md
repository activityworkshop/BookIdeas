# BookIdeas
Not so much free software, but discussions of ideas for future books.

Writing a new book is a daunting prospect, and it would really help to know in advance whether there is sufficient interest in the subject to make it worthwhile.  So the purpose of this repository is to provoke and encourage discussion on whether anyone is interested in these proposals and what they would like to see.

It's based on the overview here: https://activityworkshop.net/books/ but hopefully the possibility of raising Issues on this repository will help stimulate feedback.

## GpsPrune user guide
This user guide for the GpsPrune application https://github.com/activityworkshop/GpsPrune is already available, see here for more details: https://gpsprune.activityworkshop.net/userguide.html .

If you have any feedback, criticism, suggestions, or requests, you can raise them either here or in the GpsPrune repo.

## Geocaching for Geeks
As outlined on the web page, this proposal is for a collaboration project combining some technical / geeky / programming / puzzle topics together with practical applications to the hobby of geocaching.

Some ideas of things to discuss:
 * a brief introduction to geocaching for those who have never done it before (how to find simple caches with GPS, ways to use GpsPrune etc)
 * some theory (representation of GPS coordinates, different coordinate systems, terminology)
 * Multi-caches and calculations, some geocaching jargon
 * Puzzle caches and Checkers
 * using Python or Java to solve puzzles (at a getting started level)
 * techniques used in advanced puzzles, like data encoding systems (eg ascii, base64, hex, braille, semaphore, morse), simple encryption systems (ROT13, Caesar, Vignere, ...), other data-hiding tricks
 * online resources, tools, discussion forums, etiquette

Like the sound of those topics?  Anything you'd like to see here but isn't mentioned yet?  Strongly prefer `epub` to `pdf` or any other specific requests?  Any suggestions for scope / intended audience?  Please raise an issue!

## Alpine Pass Route
This idea of writing an ebook about the Swiss hiking route has been thrown around for years but the response has been very low, and alternatives exist (on paper) already.  So I guess that this won't work, but I'll raise it again anyway.  Interested?  Or alternative ideas?  Please raise an issue!
